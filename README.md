# rp2040
Making first disassembler of  ARM v6m Thumb instructions and then turning it to simulator of Raspberry Pico RP2040 chip/board.

I am learning about Typescript from the similar project in that language and felt inspired to refresh my Python a bit and also knowledge of
new ARM chips as a former owner of original ARM computer Acorn Archimedes "A340" (A310 expanded to 4 MB by a technician) until it broke down at end of 80'ies.

UPDATE: Now working with Pico bootrom and found potential problem with disassembler, but finally I had accidently changed the line in disassembly.
